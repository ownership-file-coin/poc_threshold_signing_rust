test threshold::tests::test_frost_key_generation ... ok
test threshold::tests::test_threshold_signing ... ok

test result: ok. 7 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

‚úÖ **Status**: VERIFIED - All Rust library tests pass

---

## Step 2: Install SP1 Toolchain

### 2.1: Install sp1up (SP1 installer)

```bash
curl -L https://sp1.succinct.xyz | bash
```

**What this does**: Downloads and installs the `sp1up` tool to `~/.sp1/bin/sp1up`

**Actual Output**:
```
üöÄ Installing sp1up...

warning: libusb not found. You may need to install it manually on MacOS via Homebrew (brew install libusb).

‚úÖ Installation complete!

üîç Detected shell: zsh
üîó Added sp1up to PATH

To start using sp1up, please run:

‚ñ∂ source /Users/johndickerson/.zshenv
‚ñ∂ sp1up
```

‚úÖ **Status**: COMPLETED

### 2.2: Add sp1up to PATH

```bash
# Add to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
export PATH="$HOME/.sp1/bin:$PATH"

# Reload shell or run:
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

### 2.3: Verify sp1up installation

```bash
which sp1up
sp1up --version
```

**Expected**:
```
/Users/johndickerson/.sp1/bin/sp1up
sp1up x.x.x
```

### 2.4: Install SP1 toolchain

```bash
sp1up
```

**What this does**: Installs the complete SP1 toolchain including `cargo-prove`

**Actual Output**:
```
.______  ._______ ._______ ._______ ._______ ._______ ._______ ._______ ._______

```

‚úÖ **Status**: COMPLETED

### 2.5: Verify cargo-prove installation

```bash
which cargo-prove
cargo prove --version
```

**Expected**:
```
/Users/johndickerson/.sp1/bin/cargo-prove
cargo-prove x.x.x
```

---

## Step 2.6: Update Rust to Latest Version (REQUIRED)

**Issue Encountered**: Initial build failed with:
```
feature `edition2024` is required
The package requires the Cargo feature called `edition2024`, but that feature is not stabilized in this version of Cargo (1.81.0)
```

**Solution**: Update Rust to version 1.90.0 or later

```bash
rustup update
rustc --version  # Should show 1.90.0 or later
```

**Actual Output**:
```
stable-x86_64-apple-darwin updated - rustc 1.90.0 (1159e78c4 2025-09-14)
rustc 1.90.0 (1159e78c4 2025-09-14)
cargo 1.90.0 (840b83a10 2025-07-30)
```

‚úÖ **Status**: COMPLETED

---

## Step 3: Build SP1 Guest Program

### 3.1: Navigate to program directory

```bash
cd /Users/johndickerson/GITHUB_HOSTING/poc_threshold_signing_rust/rust_threshold_signing/program
```

### 3.2: Set PATH for cargo-prove

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.sp1/bin:$PATH"
```

**Why**: `cargo prove` needs to be in PATH for the build command

### 3.3: Build the RISC-V guest program

```bash
cargo prove build
```

**What this does**: Compiles the guest program to RISC-V bytecode for SP1

**Actual Output**:
```
cargo:warning=rustc +succinct --version: "rustc 1.88.0-dev\n"
[sp1]     Compiling proc-macro2 v1.0.101
[sp1]     Compiling quote v1.0.41
[sp1]     Compiling unicode-ident v1.0.19
[sp1]     Compiling serde_core v1.0.228
[... many more crates ...]
[sp1]     Compiling threshold-signing-lib v0.1.0
[sp1]     Compiling threshold-signing-program v0.1.0
[sp1]      Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 32.07s
cargo:rustc-env=SP1_ELF_threshold-signing-program=/Users/johndickerson/GITHUB_HOSTING/poc_threshold_signing_rust/rust_threshold_signing/target/elf-compilation/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf/release/threshold-signing-program
```

‚úÖ **Status**: COMPLETED

**Build Artifacts Created**:
- RISC-V ELF at: `/Users/johndickerson/GITHUB_HOSTING/poc_threshold_signing_rust/rust_threshold_signing/target/elf-compilation/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf/release/threshold-signing-program`
- Size: 260 KB

### 3.4: Copy ELF to Expected Location

**Why**: The host program expects the ELF at `program/elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf`

```bash
# Create elf directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p elf

# Copy the built ELF to expected location
cp ../target/elf-compilation/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf/release/threshold-signing-program \
   elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf
```

**What this does**: Copies the RISC-V executable to the location where `host/src/main.rs` expects to find it via `include_bytes!("../../program/elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf")`

### 3.5: Verify ELF file exists at expected location

```bash
ls -lh elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf
file elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf
```

**Expected Output**:
```
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff   260K  elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf
elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, RISC-V, version 1 (SYSV)
```

---

## Step 4: Run Host Program (Generate Proof)

### 4.1: Navigate to host directory

```bash
cd ../host
```

### 4.2: Fix SP1 API compatibility issues

**Issue Encountered**: The SP1 SDK API has changed. The `prove()` method now uses a builder pattern.

**Required Code Changes**:

1. Change `client.prove(&pk, stdin).expect()` to `client.prove(&pk, stdin).run().expect()`
2. Change `let proof =` to `let mut proof =` (public_values.read() requires mutability)

**Files Modified**: `host/src/main.rs` lines 71

### 4.3: Set PATH and run the host program

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.sp1/bin:$PATH"
cargo run --release
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Proof generation can take 15-30+ minutes or longer depending on your system
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Be patient - no progress output during proving is NORMAL
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The process is CPU-intensive and may max out your cores
- ‚úÖ As long as it doesn't error, it's working correctly

**What this does**:
1. Generates FROST threshold keys (5 signers, 3-of-5 threshold)
2. Performs threshold signing
3. Verifies signature locally
4. Generates SP1 zkVM proof
5. Verifies the proof
6. Saves proof artifacts

**Actual Output (In Progress)**:
```
=== Threshold Signature SP1 zkVM Demo ===

Configuration:
  Threshold: 3/5
  Message: "Hello, threshold signatures in zkVM!"

Generating FROST threshold keys...
Keys generated successfully

Performing threshold signing...
  Using signers: [1, 2, 3]
Threshold signature created

Verifying signature locally...
Local verification successful

Generating SP1 proof...
Proving (this may take a few minutes)...
[CURRENTLY RUNNING - Proof generation in progress]
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ FROST keys generated, ‚úÖ Threshold signature created, ‚úÖ Local verification passed, ‚ùå Proof generation failed

**Error Encountered**:
```
thread '<unnamed>' panicked at p3-air-0.1.4-succinct/src/virtual_column.rs:25:33:
index out of bounds: the len is 70 but the index is 101
```

**Root Cause**: Internal SP1 prover error (not our code). The zkVM infrastructure encountered an index out of bounds panic during proof generation.

**What This Means**:
- ‚úÖ Our threshold signature implementation is correct (local verification passed)
- ‚úÖ The RISC-V guest program compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ SP1 can load and begin executing our program
- ‚ùå SP1 3.4.0 appears to have issues with complex ed25519 verification in zkVM

**Expected Final Output** (will update when complete):
```
=== Threshold Signature SP1 zkVM Demo ===

Configuration:
  Threshold: 3/5
  Message: "Hello, threshold signatures in zkVM!"

Generating FROST threshold keys...
Keys generated successfully

Performing threshold signing...
  Using signers: [1, 2, 3]
Threshold signature created

Verifying signature locally...
Local verification successful

Generating SP1 proof...
Proving (this may take a few minutes)...
[Progress updates]
Proof generated successfully!

Verifying proof...
Proof verified successfully!

=== Results ===
Signature valid in zkVM: true
Public key: [hex string]
Message: "Hello, threshold signatures in zkVM!"

Saving proof for on-chain verification...
Proof and verification key saved!

=== Demo Complete ===
```

**Expected Artifacts**:
- `../solidity_threshold_signing/proof.bin` - Serialized proof
- `../solidity_threshold_signing/vk.bin` - Verification key

### 4.3: Verify proof artifacts exist

```bash
ls -lh ../solidity_threshold_signing/proof.bin
ls -lh ../solidity_threshold_signing/vk.bin
```

---

## Step 5: Install Foundry (for Solidity testing)

### 5.1: Install Foundry

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 5.2: Verify Foundry installation

```bash
forge --version
cast --version
anvil --version
```

**Expected**:
```
forge 0.x.x
cast 0.x.x
anvil 0.x.x
```

---

## Step 6: Test Solidity Contracts

### 6.1: Navigate to Solidity directory

```bash
cd ../../solidity_threshold_signing
```

### 6.2: Install Solidity dependencies

```bash
forge install
```

### 6.3: Build Solidity contracts

```bash
forge build
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[‚†¢] Compiling...
[‚†Ü] Compiling X files with 0.8.20
[‚†∞] Solc 0.8.20 finished in XXms
Compiler run successful
```

### 6.4: Run Solidity tests

```bash
forge test -vvv
```

**Expected Output** (will be filled in after running):
```
Running tests...

Test results:
- test_DeploymentSuccessful() (gas: XXX)
- test_VerifyThresholdSignatureView() (gas: XXX)

Test result: ok. X passed; 0 failed
```

---

## Step 7: End-to-End Verification

### 7.1: Run complete E2E script

```bash
cd ..
./scripts/e2e.sh
```

**What this does**: Runs the complete pipeline:
1. Builds Rust library
2. Builds SP1 guest program
3. Runs host to generate proof
4. Builds Solidity contracts
5. Tests Solidity contracts

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `cargo-prove not found`
**Solution**:
```bash
sp1up
source ~/.zshrc  # or your shell config
```

### Issue: SP1 build fails with "toolchain not found"
**Solution**:
```bash
rustup toolchain install stable
sp1up --reinstall
```

### Issue: Out of memory during proof generation
**Solution**: Proof generation is memory-intensive. Close other applications or use a machine with more RAM.

### Issue: Solidity test fails with "SP1 verifier not found"
**Solution**: Deploy the SP1 verifier contract first or use a mock verifier for testing.

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All Rust tests pass (7/7)
‚¨ú SP1 guest program builds successfully
‚¨ú Host program generates proof without errors
‚¨ú Proof verifies successfully
‚¨ú Proof artifacts are created (proof.bin, vk.bin)
‚¨ú Solidity contracts compile
‚¨ú Solidity tests pass

---

## Next Steps After Setup

1. **Modify the message**: Edit `host/src/main.rs` to sign different messages
2. **Change threshold**: Adjust the threshold parameters (e.g., 2-of-3, 5-of-7)
3. **Deploy to testnet**: Configure `.env` and run deployment script
4. **Performance testing**: Measure proof generation time and gas costs
